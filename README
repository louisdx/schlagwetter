Schlagwetter, a Minecraft server

Inspired and hopefully collaborating with Fador's "mineserver: https://github.com/fador/mineserver


When fetching this repository, make sure to get the cNBT submodule, too. Try this:

  mkdir /tmp/workspace
  cd /tmp/workspace
  git clone git://github.com/louisdx/schlagwetter.git
  cd schlagwetter
  git submodule update --init cNBT/


Design goals:

  *  Portability. Idiomatic C++0x and boost::ASIO, boost::program_options. (Other libraries: cNBT, ZLib, Noise, GNU Readline [optional]).

  *  Robustness: Server code must be 100% correct.
     Commits are only accepted if they pass memory debugging (valgrind) without errors.

  *  Efficient: Memory footprint should be as low as possible, CPU usage likewise.
