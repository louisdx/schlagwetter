I haven't worked out any particular licensing yet.
Basically, the source is free for re-use with attribution
and maintainance of the same terms.

Particular contribution credits are in order:

- cNBT, an NBT library, from https://github.com/FliPPeh/cNBT.
  This library is used directly and without modifications;
  apparently it is under a "do whatever you want" beerware license.

- ZLIB and libnoise are used directly as is, see their respective licenses.

- Ditto GNU Readline, if you enable it.

- The main inspiration, and hopefully large parts of the code,
  (will) come from the mineserver project: https://github.com/fador/mineserver

  I will try to mark up code that is used directly, though my design
  is rather different and bits of that code may end up appearing in refactored
  form in my code. Here is the current state of affairs:
  
  constants.h/.cpp: I have taken over all the definitions verbatim.

  map.cpp: I have taken over the code for the light map generation in large parts.

  generator.h/.cpp: I have taken over the code for heightmap generation
     and cave generation in large parts, though refactored. Probably a lot
     more map generation code will be taken from this project (and maybe from
     craftd).

  Many thanks to everyone on the mineserver team!
