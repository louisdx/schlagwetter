Highest Priority
----------------

* The network protocol isn't working right. A client can connect
  once after server start, but subsequent connections fail with
  varying errors. Getting the basic networking to function reliably
  is of the greatest importance.

Update: This may be better now, I fixed some silly typo-bugs ((X,X) instead of (X,Z) etc.).


High Priority
-------------

* Lots of the protocol has not been implemented yet and is only a stub.
  Block removal (digging) works, but placement doesn't. Getting basic
  creative mode play style going is the first step.

* Persistent map storage. Doesn't have to be NBT, anything sensible would be good.
  Maybe Boost::serialize.

* Dynamic blocks (water, lave) are missing ("physics").


Known Issues (may be easy to fix)
---------------------------------

* Chunk zip cache and tainting doesn't seem to taint modified chunks in all cases (all non-0,0 chunks?).

* Light map doesn't get regenerated when loading tainted chunks.

* Light map generation doesn't seem to get under-water lighting right.

* Torch block saving broken (currenly just naive, Torch isn't attached to the correct neighbour).


Mystery Puzzle of the Day
-------------------------

The spawn location is wrong. With PLAYER_CHUNK_HORIZON = 5, you spawn inside the cave
rather than on top. With PLAYER_CHUNK_HORIZON = 2, you do spawn correctly on top. Why?


Further Goals
-------------

* Completely server-side judication. Inventory and placement could be
  determined and validated entirely by the server.
