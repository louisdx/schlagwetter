Highest Priority
----------------

* The network protocol isn't working right. A client can connect
  once after server start, but subsequent connections fail with
  varying errors. Getting the basic networking to function reliably
  is of the greatest importance.


High Priority
-------------

* Lots of the protocol has not been implemented yet and is only a stub.
  Block removal (digging) works, but placement doesn't. Getting basic
  creative mode play style going is the first step.

* Persistent map storage. Doesn't have to be NBT, anything sensible would be good.
  Maybe Boost::serialize.


Further Goals
-------------

* Completely server-side judication. Inventory and placement could be
  determined and validated entirely by the server.
